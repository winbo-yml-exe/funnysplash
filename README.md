## FunnySplash
Modified splash.img/logo.bin to be funny for Xiaomi devices

# How to add devices (aka contribute)
- 1: Fork the repo
- 2: Make a new folder named after the codename of your device with the file "dummy.txt"
- 2.1: If the phone has multiple codenames (like the Redmi 13C with "gale" and "gust), name the folder "1codename+2codename" (example: gale+gust)
- 3: Upload contents of modified splash.img/logo.bin and then delete dummy.txt
- 4: Make a pull request

### IMPORTANT NOTE: Test your splash.img or logo.bin before contributing!!!
If you can't test them, add it to the untested list below:

# Untested list
- gale (because I didn't even make a funny logo.bin for it yet)
